This is a Lightning development collective. With the cost of software development being driven into the ground by
agentic AI, this production system tries to take into account developers time and current development trends.

## Operation driven

Every project is a strict, defined, small-scoped idea. The starting repo contains a Vue 4 project with the style guide.

### Builds

- Production build: https://example.com/production
- Staging build: https://example.com/staging

## Contributors

Contributors get an enamel pin.

## Lifecycle

Once goals are completed, a project goes into maintenance mode.
